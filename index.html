    <h1>Magnificent Crete</h1>
     <h2>Getting to know Crete</h2>
      <p>Crete (Greek: Κρήτη, Modern: Kríti, Ancient: Krḗtē, [krέːtεː]) is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, the 88th largest island in the world and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus and Corsica. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean Sea. Crete rests approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).</p>

     <h2>History of Crete</h2>
      <p>Humans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic age. Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.</p>

        <h2>Island morphology</h2>
          <p>The island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to Ierapetra). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km2 (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the Sea of Crete (Greek: Κρητικό Πέλαγος); to the south, the South Cretian Sea (Greek: Νότιο Κρητικό Πέλαγος); in the west, the Myrtoan Sea, and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.</p>
  
      <h3>Mountains and valleys</h3>
        <p>Crete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:</p>

          <ul>
             <li>The White Mountains or Lefka Ori 2,454 m (8,051 ft)</li>
             <li>The Idi Range (Psiloritis 35.18°N 24.82°E 2,456 m (8,058 ft)</li>
             <li>Asterousia Mountains 1,231 m (4,039 ft)</li>
             <li>Kedros 1,777 m (5,830 ft)</li>
             <li>The Dikti Mountains 2,148 m (7,047 ft)</li>
             <li>Thripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)</li>
           </ul>

          <p>These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as Amari valley, fertile plateaus, such as Lasithi plateau, Omalos and Nidha; caves, such as Gourgouthakas, Diktaion, and Idaion (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus); and a number of gorges.</p>
